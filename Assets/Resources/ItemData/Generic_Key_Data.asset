  _ItemName: Old Key
  _Definition: "\"Encrusted with the patina of age and neglect, the old rusty key
    exudes an air of mystery and antiquity. Its once-shining surface is now dulled
    by the passage of time, adorned with patches of rust that cling to its weathered
    frame like ancient battle scars. \n\n As you hold it in your hand, you can't
    help but wonder about the stories it could tell and the journeys it has witnessed.\""
