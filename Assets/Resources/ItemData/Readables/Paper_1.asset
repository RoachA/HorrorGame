  _ItemName: Entry of "Second Invocation To Emperor Lucifer"
  _Definition: 'The worn-out and dusty parchment, its surface weathered by time and
    neglect, bears the weight of ages past.


    The parchment before you holds
    a fragment of the Solomonic manuscript. This particular excerpt delves into the
    enigmatic Second Invocation to Emperor Lucifer, a pivotal incantation believed
    to unlock profound secrets of power and illumination.'

  _readableText: 'Prior to reading of the Third invocation, if the Spirit doesn''t
    appear, read the Clavicle as follows, and strike all of the Spirits, putting
    the two ends of the fork of your rod in the fire. At this point do not be frightened
    by the horrible cries that you will hear because all of the Spirits will appear.
    Before reading the Clavicle, while the noise continues, read again the third
    invocation.


    "I command you, Emperor Lucifer, by the great living God, his
    dear son and the Holy Ghost and by the power of the great ADONAY, ELOHIM, ARIEL
    and JEHOVA, to appear now or send me your ASTAROTH. I command you to abandon
    your dwelling in whatever part of the world it should be, declaring to you that
    if you do not appear immediately, I will strike you and all of your cohorts again
    with the Blasting Rod of the great ADONAY, ELOHIM, ARIEL and JEHOVA"


    ...'
